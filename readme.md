An incomplete open source and interesting take on an iPad client for reddit.

I am accepting pull requests. If the client ever comes to a complete state
I will releaes it for free on the App Store under the AlterTap account. No 
profits will be made by me. This is entirely a community effort.

Here is what it looks like:
