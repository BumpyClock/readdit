Readdit
=======

An incomplete open source and interesting take on an iPad client for reddit.

It is licensed under the Apache Software License Version 2.0.

I am accepting pull requests. If the client ever comes to a complete state
I will releaes it for free on the App Store under the AlterTap account. No 
profits will be made by me. This is entirely a community effort.

Building it:
===========

It's really simple. You just need Xcode. Clone the repository somewhere and,
open Readdit/Readdit.xcodeproj and run in the simulator to get started quickly.

What does it do? (so far)
=========================
  
* Fully integrated with your reddit account. Subscribe and unsubscribe
  from reddits. (tap the magnifying glass on the subreddits listing)
* "Pile" which is sort of like opening an interesting link in a
  background tab. It will save and pre-cache your links in a in the
  background for later viewing. Swipe over an item in the list to put
  it in the pile.
* "Magazine" which is sort of like an endlessly scrolling wall of 
	  images that link to reddit stories. Great for viewing
  photograph-heavy reddits.

What does it need?
==================

Discussion for the development of this client will occur on our own subreddit
here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/readditapp/

Here are some ideas to get started with:

* "Magazine" needs a code refresh. It's a bit craggy and there are
  some decent open source grid views that can be used now. It's
  currently a sideways table view (hah!)
* Comments! One of the best thing about reddit and it's not here!
* Profile interface for users. It would be neat to be able to view an
  overview of a user in the app.
* An interesting way to put things in the pile. For instance, a drawer
  could slide out from underneath the item list on swipe, the item
  drops into the drawer then it closes. Just an idea.
* iPhone version. This is iOS, and it could be easily ported to work
  fine on the iPhone.
* Bug fixes, plugging memory leaks, and general polish.
* Whatever you want! It's bloody open source.
